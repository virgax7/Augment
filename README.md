-- A note about tests..

I originate from a TDD company and can just say don't write tests like this... Too lazy to put the effort to write the two, but I put in some lazy so called "tests" for some things I want assurance on..

Also... no javascript frameworks are used.. and possibly older less elegant syntax.. However, it's all for learning.



Oh and I wish Java 9 and Project Lombok would work together, but as of now no :/
